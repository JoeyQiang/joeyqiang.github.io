Hey, this is **Joey Qiang**. 

I was born in HeFei, China, and got my Bachelor's degree in Information Management & Information System from **HuaZhong University of Science & Technology**.

Currently, I am a graduate student studying **Interaction Design** on **University of Kansas**, located in Lawrence, America.

I spend a lot of my time working on product desgin and website design & development, looking forward to finding **internship** on the summer vocation in 2016 and full-time job in 2017, whose title should be relevant with interaction design, wherever in China or in America.

If you would like to hire me, please contact me by  <a href="mailto:joeyqiang@mail.com" target="_blank">joeyqiang@gmail.com</a>.

Moreover, please do not hesitate to contact me if you are also interested in interaction designs. Maybe we could become good friends, who knows!

Here are vary kinds of definitions of `Interaction Design` I saw in different places. By reading all of them, probably we can get a clear idea about what is interaction design. 

> *Designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives.*<br/>
— Interaction Design [beyond human–computer interaction 4th edition]

By the way, in my point of view, definition is just a idealist form which does not have any meanings without connect to the reality. The best way for to have a deep understanding of something to take part into it in person. Just as Chairman Mao said: 「The practice is only criterion for testing truth」. 

If you have any other definitions about interaction design, plz do not hesitate to tell me. Let's make it more comprehensive together.

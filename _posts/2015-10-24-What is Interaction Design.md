Here are vary kinds of definitions of `Interaction Design` I saw in different places. By reading all of them, probably we can get a clear idea about what is interaction design. 

> **Interactive Design is defined as a user-oriented field of study that focuses on meaningful communication of media through cyclical and collaborative processes between people and technology.**
– Wikipedia

***

> **Designing interactive products to support the way people communicate and interact in their everyday and working lives.**
– Interaction Design [beyond human–computer interaction 4th edition]

***

> **Interaction design is about shaping digital things for people’s use**.
– Jonas Lowgren


By the way, in my point of view, definition is just a idealist form which does not have any meanings without connect to the reality. The best way for to have a deep understanding of something to take part into it in person. Just as Chairman Mao said: 「The practice is only criterion for testing truth」.

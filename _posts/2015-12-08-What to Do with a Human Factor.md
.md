title: What to Do with a Human Factor

> This is easily the most important question to ask in human factors research, yet no one seems to do so. The simple answer is "is use them to design better products." Pretty snappy answer as far as it goes, it just doesn't go very far. Traditional human factors work tries to satisfy existing needs and conditions. But human factors research should try to exceed user expectations and, ultimately, to create them. Take this issue seriously and it revolutionizes what we should study, how we ought to study it, and the relationship of design to other disciplines.

## Introduction
We created a scenario that tells how a textbook influences our decisions on what something means through the individual, social and cultural levels. Through analyzing the scenario, we made a concept map to summarize our ideas. 

## Persona

![Jonathan Dericks](http://7xoj81.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/2015-12-08-01.png)

| Attr  | Val |
| - | - |
| Name  | Jonathan Dericks  |
| Age  | 18  |
| Ethnicity  | African American  |
| From  | Olathe Kansas  |
| Major  | Communication Studies  |
| Age  | 18  |
| School  | he University of Kansas  |

The persona is currently enrolled in a Sociology class. We will analyze how the artifact [textbook] would influence him, then  further effect other things.

## Affects Individual

> **Artifacts** will affect particular **frameworks**, encouraging differences in **expectations** and **prejudices** about the parts of the world affected by the artifact.
– Rick E. Robinson

Jon’s Sociology textbook **[artifact]** affects his established ideas **[frameworks]**, altering his viewpoints **[expectations/prejudices]** on society.

Ex. After completing the course, Jon realizes that he wants to major in sociology and eventually become a school counselor.


## Affects Social

> Shared use and understanding of either the artifacts or the understanding enabled by them will affect the **vocabularies** and **approaches** of interpretive communities.
– Rick E. Robinson

Jon and his classmates learn new words and meanings **[vocabularies]**, changing their behavior **[approach]** within the classroom.

Ex. Jon and his classmates learn and academically discuss how the terms **gender** and **sex** have different meanings. Jon and his classmates will no longer use the terms interchangeably. 

## Affects Cultural

> The ways in which designed artifacts affect the systems in which they participate.
– Rick E. Robinson

The Sociology textbook **[artifact]** contains the most up-to-date information on the subject, revealing to the students their **system’s** most recent discoveries and teachings.

Ex. Jon eventually receives a Ph.D in Sociology, writing new textbooks for students and becoming an advisor on political agendas, affecting the culture.

## Concept Map

Here is the illustration explaining the interrelated relationships among individual, social and cultural.

## Conclusion

1. Everybody inevitably has its own biases/perceptions toward the world. Therefore, please have empathy to people who are different from you and try to understand them. Don't be arrogant.
2. Design artifacts based on one's previous perceptions. Come up with ideas that could influence one's ideas. After that, bridging kind of connection between the single individual and the society [share] to expand the effect.
3. Be confident. Though we are all living under the restrictions of the world, make progress/innovations everyday and keep going. Maybe one day we can change the world [culture]. Who knows?

## Other

Today, I finished the first course of the semester – Advanced Human Factors. I would like to say, I learned a lot from the course, or put it in another way, I learned a lot from self-studying. What I harvest is the thinking mode of design, which reinforces the belief to be an interaction designer, instead of the rote stuff.

The most urgent problem for me is the language issue. Nonetheless I can totally understand others [English native speakers], it is almost impossible that I can speak as fluent as them. Anyway, to be a better designer, I have to grab every opportunity to practice speaking considering how important communication skills means to designers.

Last but not least,  best wishes for my Tech Trek to Silicon Valley in January and hopefully I can find a decent internship then.

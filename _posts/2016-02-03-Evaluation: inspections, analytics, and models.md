After we finish our interaction work, we need a set of principles to help us double-check or evaluate our works, so that we can find shortages and correct all of them in time.

Here is the introduction of **Heuristic Evaluation**:

- **Visibility of system status**: The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.

- **Match between system and the real world**: The system should speak the users’ language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural
and logical order.

- **User control and freedom**: Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked emergency exit to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialog. Support undo and redo.

- **Consistency and standards**: Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.

- **Error prevention**: Even better than good error messages is a careful design that prevents a problem from occurring tin the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.

- **Recognition rather than recall**: Minimize the user’s memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialog to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.

- **Flexibility and efficiency of use**: Accelerators - unseen by the novice user - may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced an experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.

- **Aesthetic and minimalist design**: Dialogs should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialog competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility

- **Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**: Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

- **Help and documentation**: Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the user’s task, list concrete steps to carried out, and not be too large.

Specifically, here is the **Heuristic Evaluation for Websites**:

**Clarity**: Make the system as clear, concise and meaningful as possible for the intended audience.

- write clear, concise copy
- Only use technical language for a technical audience
- Write clear and meaningful labels
- Use meaningful icons

**Minimize unnecessary complexity and cognitive load**: Make a system as simple as possible for users to accomplish their tasks.

- Remove unnecessary functionality, process steps, and visual clutter
- Use progressive disclosure to hide advanced features
- Break down complicated processes into multiple steps
- Prioritize using size, shape, color, alignment and proximity

**Provide users with context**: Interfaces should provide users with a sense of context in time and shape

- Provide a clear site name and purpose
- Highlight the current section in the navigation
- Use appropriate feedback messages
- Show humber of steps in a process
- Reduce perception of latency by providing visual cues (e.g.progress indicator) or by allowing users to complete other tasks while waiting.

**Promote a pleasurable and positive user experience**: The user should be treated with respect and the design should be aesthetically pleasing and promote a pleasurable and rewarding experience.

- Create a pleasurable and attractive design.
- Provide easily attainable goals.
- Provide rewards for usage and progression.


In conclusion, we can definitely find different usability problems after we made evaluation. In this condition, we should based on the frequency and weight of each problem to determine which is prior problem that need to solve immediately, which can be solved a little bit later.

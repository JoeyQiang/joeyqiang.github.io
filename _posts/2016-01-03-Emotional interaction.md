Most people would like to tag themselves as rational people rather than emotional people. However, unfortunately, we are not. When we have a good mood, we tend to think the product to be more enjoyable, vice versa.

Therefore, when we design tasks for user, especially serious tasks, we need to special attention to all the information required to do the task at that interface should be visible with clear and unambiguous feedback, bring them a happy atmosphere.

For peoples' reflections, there are three types: 

- **visceral reflection**: reflections you born with or deeply root in your heart, like draw your hand back when your hand feel hurt. 
- **behavioral reflection**: after practicing something millions of time, you get reflections very naturally even you do not understand it, like driving.
- **reflective reflection**: reflections to certain circumstances, which varies based on your previous experience and improvisational reflection.

In light of these three reflectional types, there are accordingly three types of design. 

- **Visceral design** refers to making products look, feel, and sound good. 
- **Behavioral design** is about use and equates with traditional values of usability. 
- **Reflective design** is about taking into account the meaning and personal value of a product in a particular culture. 

Here are several tips to help us better design product to fulfil these goals:

- Dynamic icons (e.g. a recycle bin expanding when a file is placed in it and paper disappearing in a puff when emptied)
- Animations (e.g. a beach ball whirling to say the computer is busy)
- Spoken messages, using various kinds of voices, telling the user what needs to be done(e.g. GPS navigation system instructing you politely where to go after having taken a wrong turn.)
- Various notifications indicating actions and events (e.g. whoosh for window closing, schlook for a file being dragged, ding for new email arriving).
- Vibrotactile feedback, such as distinct smartphone buzzes that specifically represent special messages from friends and family.

Anyway, aesthetically pleasing interfaces can be a pleasure to use. On the other hand, badly designed interfaces often make people frustrated, annoyed, or angry.

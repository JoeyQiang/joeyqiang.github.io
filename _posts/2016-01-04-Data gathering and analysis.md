Data is an invaluable property for interaction designer, especially the data got from user. I use [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/?gclid=Cj0KEQiA_MK0BRDQsf_bsZS-_OIBEiQADPf--mpQ4JZn6PfejkC3Ug93BgHQvnyM0FrhpZaXIT14mEsaAt7A8P8HAQ) to gather data of my personal blog, see the pic below.

Through analyzing the data, I can track the trace of user browsing my website. Then I could capture key design issues for my blog by three questions: Where am I? Whatâ€™s here? Where can I go?

If we need to design a way to collect data ourselves, here are five key issues that require attention for any data gathering session to be successful:

- goal setting
- identifying participants
- the relationship between the data collector and the data provider
- triangulation
- pilot studies

As far as I am concerned, two key points for data gathering. One is all data gathering sessions should have clear goals. The other one is that choosing appropriate data gathering techniques depends on the focus of the study, the participants involved, the nature of the technique, and the resources available.

After we gather data, firsts steps in analyzing data:

- **Interviews:** transcription of recordings. Expansion of notes.
- **Questionaries:** clean up data. Filter into different data sets.
- **Observation:** expansion of notes. Transcription of recordings. Synchronization between data recordings.

Next, if data acquired is quantitative, we use specific algorithm or formula to calculate the results we need. If data is qualitative, our priorities are to identify recurring patterns and themes, and find critical incidents.

Looking domestic Internet giants, Alibaba is the best one, I suppose, in the ability to gather data and then analyze it, whose results are fantastic. It can even track your address just through analyzing the wifi data that you connect your wifi to any of its wifi platform. Technology is really can change the world !

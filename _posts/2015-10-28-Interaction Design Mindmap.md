Here is the [interaction Design Mindmap](https://www.processon.com/view/link/56306280e4b0ae8573ff4f8e) made by Joey.

I would like to use mindmap to connect all useful principles or concepts together, which can help me organize the knowledge I have learnt better. Afterwards, with accumulating of my knowledge, hopefully I am gonna form my typical thinking pattern for interaction design.

If you have any good ideas wanna to add, plz no hesitate to comment below. Let's make it awesome together!

Keep update...

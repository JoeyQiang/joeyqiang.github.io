To better help everyone in a project to understand interaction, we need to form a consensus by asking people following questions:

* Are there problems with an existing product or user experience? If so, what are they?
* Why do you think there are problems?
* How do you think your proposed design ideas might overcome these?
* If you have not identified any problems and instead are designing for a new user experience, how do you think your proposed design ideas support, change, or extend current ways of doing things.

When discussing these problems, everyone should be open-minded, trying to have a deep thought from different people's viewpoint, such as developers, designers, business people. Therefore, teammates can have a clear common ground, which allows the design team to establish a set of common terms that all can understand and agree upon, reducing the chance of misunderstandings and confusion arising later on.

Through reading the book *Thinking fast and slow*, I knew that people have two mental thinking system. System 1 is fast thinking and system 2 is slow thinking. People are inclined to use system 1 instead of system 2. Because system 1 is time-saving and energy-saving. Therefore, conceptualizing interaction is very important to help present product to users straight-forwardly. That is, building a conceptual model.

> **A conceptual model is a high-level description of a product in terms of what users can do with it and the concepts they need in order to understand how to interact with it.**

Metaphors, analogies and connection mappings are core components for conceptual model. For example, to better illustrate eBay, we can draw a graph like this:
 
![eBay conceptual model](http://7xoj81.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/2016-01-01-01.png)

The person icon is analogies to people, the agent icon is metaphor to eBay, and the solid and dash lines represent the connections between these components. Meanwhile, these lines are mapping with their own meaning, such red represents buying from, blue represents selling to, and yellow represents a kind of virtual relationships between buyers and sellers.

Also, paradigms, visions, theories, models, and frameworks can provide different ways of framing and informing design and research.

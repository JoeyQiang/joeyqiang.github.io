Cognition is very important for interaction design, because what people see may not be what people think. Conversely, what people think determines what they see. So, we need to analyze people's mental model to design better product to help user understand what it means.

Cognition has been described in terms of specific kinds of processes:

* Attention
* Perception
* Memory
* Learning
* Reading, speaking, and listening
* Problem solving, planning, reasoning, and decision making

And for each process, we get some design implications.

### Attention:

> - Make information salient when it needs attending to at a given stage of task
- Use techniques like animated graphics, color, underlining, ordering of items, sequencing of different information, and spacing of items to achieve this
- Avoid cluttering the interface with too much information. This especially applies to the use of color, sound, and graphics: it is tempting to use lots, resulting in a mishmash of media that is distracting and annoying rather than helping the user attend to relevant information.
- Search engines and form fill-ins that have simple and clean interfaces are easier to use.

### Perception:

> - Icons and other graphical representations should enable users to readily distinguish their meaning.
- Bordering and spacing are effective visual way of grouping information that makes it easier to perceive and locate items.
- Sounds should be audible and distinguishable so users understand what they represent.
- Speech output should enable users to distinguish between the set of spoken words and also be able to understand their meaning.
- Text should be legible and distinguishable from the the background (e.g. it is okay to use yellow text on a black or blue background but not on a white or green background).
- Tactile feedback used in virtual environments should allow users to recognize the meaning of the various touch sensations being emulated. The feedback should be distinguishable so that, for example, the sensation of squeezing is represented in a tactile form that is different from the sensation of pushing.

### Memory:

> - Do not overload user’s memories with complicated procedures for carrying out tasks.
- Design interfaces that promote recognition rather than recall by using menus, icons, and consistently placed objects.
- Provides users with a variety of ways of encoding digital information (e.g. files, emails, images) to help them access them again easily, through the use of categories, color, tagging, time stamping, etc.

### Learning:

> - Design interfaces that encourage exploration.
- Design interfaces that constrain and guide users to select appropriate actions when initially learning.
- Dynamically link concrete representation and abstract concepts to facilitate the learning of complex material.

### Reading, speaking, and listening:

> - Keep the length of speech-based and instructions to a minimum. Research has shown that people find it hard to follow spoken menus with more than three or four options. Likewise, they are bad at remembering sets of instructions and directions that have more than a few parts.
- Accentuate the intonation of artificially generate speech voices, as they are harder to understand than human voices.
- Provide opportunities for making text large on a screen, without affecting the formatting, for people who find it hard to read small text.

### Problem solving, planning, reasoning, and decision making:

> - Provide additional hide information that is easy to access for users who wish to understand more about how to carry out an activity more effectively (e.g. web searching).
- Use simple and memorable functions at the interface for computational aids intended to support rapid decision making and planning that takes place while on the move.

Having a better understanding of human beings' cognitive aspects can greatly contribute to a more user-friendly product. You try to put yourself into the position of real user, and then think all kinds of circumstances from their viewpoints, which is the key point for your product to boom. 

Last but not least, I would like to recommend a super famous book about analyzing psychological effects to design – *Everything in Design*. It states several design principles from observing everyday things in life, which are extremely easy-understood and useful.

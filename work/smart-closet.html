                The smart closet helps users dress correctly, effectively, seamlessly and look their best, by making
                suggestions depending on their daily schedule, context and conditions. It will also give them control
                over their items, purchases, donations, borrow-lend-return history and overall inventory of their
                storage spaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was the final project of the class—scenario design. Through this course, I learnt how to tell a good
                story. A good story should have at least three basic elements: context introduction, turning point, and
                climax. After your story had these characteristics, what you needed to you was to refine it. After you
                refined your story again and again, it did get much better in the end.

            <h2>A good start was half the success</h2>
            <p>I had two girl teammates for the project. Therefore, when we began deciding the topic of our project, we
                wanted to choose one that all of us could have insights on. It would be better if we could have
                different views on the topic. Then we decided that smart closet was the topic we wanted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not only because smart home was a hot topic, but also both men and women had the demand to manage
                cloths. From my teammates’ points of view, they understood the problems a girl may have about dressing.
                And as a boy, I could provide ideas from another gender’s side, so we were a very good complement for
                each other.

    <div class="section container">

            <h5 class="work-section-title">Process</h5>
            <h2>3-What methods instructed us to analyze the problem</h2>
            <p>We used 3-What methods to help us analyze the current dressing problem, which was What has
                happened, What could happen, and What should happen?</p>
            <ul class="column-list row">
                <li class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4">
                    <img src="../images/sc-q1.png" alt="q1">
                    <h5>What has happened?</h5>
                    <span>Users needed to think about what to wear every morning, like checking
                the weather to make a decision. And they needed to know what cloths they had, where cloths were stored,
                and dressing tips. They got answers from their memory, knowledge and manually finding, and reaching our
                for help.</span>
                </li>
                <li class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4">
                    <img src="../images/sc-q2.png" alt="q2">
                    <h5>What could happen?</h5>
                    <span>Due to forgetting schedule and lacking of time, users may wear
                inappropriate clothes on certain occasions. Also, they may don’t know what should to wear at all. Even
                worse, if users realized that they needed help to get answers, sometimes they couldn’t find help from
                others, which was super distressing.</span>
                </li>
                <li class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4">
                    <img src="../images/sc-q3.png" alt="q3">
                    <h5>What should happen?</h5>
                    <span>We supposed that users could spend no time thinking of what to wear
                under the help of dressing suggestion and items locating. The system should have easily-understood interfaces, which also could interact with storage
                infrastructure. Therefore, the idea of a seamless interaction with a dressing-storage system came out.</span>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="strong">Our objective is to provide a new way to dress and store clothing items to make users
                interact with daily dressing activities naturally and seamlessly.</p>
            <p>Then we sketched a storyboard and used powerpoint to make a video as the first draft. We designed our
                storyboard in 5 main parts: introduction, scenario development, solution development, solution-character
                connection and climax. Then we could ask audiences to rank each part so that would be easier for us to
                find what we need to improve.</p>
            <p>We set five goals to our story:</p>
            <ol class="number-list">
                <li>Seamless: smooth and continues, with no apparent gaps or spaces between one part and the next</li>
                <li>Interactive: influencing or having an effect on each other</li>
                <li>Empathy: the ability to understand and share the feelings of another</li>
                <li>Effective: successful in producing a desired or intended result</li>
                <li>Understandable: capable of being apprehended or understood</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Then we invited 10 audiences to watch our video. After that, they needed to fill a questions form so that
                we could get feedback to improve our storyboard.</p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/sc-interview.png" alt="Interview questionnaire">
            </div>
            <p>Based on the feedbacks, for quantitative measurements, we analyzed that the understandability and empathy
                of our story were inferior to other goals. Besides, for qualitative measurements, we spotted 4 low video
                touch points.</p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/sc-measurement.png" alt="Measurements">
            </div>
            <p>Then we did the according modifications to make the storyboard more concise but more
                memorable. You could see the details of the modification from the below figure.</p>

            <p>After we finalized our cartoon video, my friend took a reality video clip to replace the cartoon one as
                our final deliverables.
                We also prepared a lot of images, sounds to vivid our final video. Then I used Photoshop and Illustrate
                to edit images, used Adobe Premium to compose all materials, and used AfterEffects to add special visual
                effects in the end.

            <h5 class="work-section-title">Reflection</h5>
            <h2>Concentration is an quality to improve your self-learning ability</h2>
            <p>
                I mastered a very important ability from the class was concentration. As a UX designer, it’s unavoidable
                that we needed to study a lot of new things to keep update with the world. Therefore, self-learning
                ability was a key qualification we should have. Of course, I always wanted to find tips to improve this
                ability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because I knew little about drawing and video making before, I had to teach myself about these things
                within a very short period to finish the project on time. So I had no other choices but kept me totally
                focus on what I needed to learn. I set the concentration task for myself, which was I couldn’t do
                anything else for every hour. Gladly, I realized I studied more things in a shorter time. I would like
                to keep the behavior for the rest of my life.

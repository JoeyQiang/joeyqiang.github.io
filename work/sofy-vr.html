                I participated in the virtual reality project of SOFY as an intern UX designer at <a
                    href="http://mobilenowgroup.com/" target="_blank">Mobile Now Group</a> (MNG).
                SOFY VR game is a mobile shooter game. Users need to download SOFY app on their smart-phone first, and
                after launching the game, they need to wear VR glasses to play the game by moving the crosshair on the
                enemies.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's an interesting and challenging experience for me because it’s the first time that I had the
                responsibility to directly negotiate with the client. Not only did I collaborate with my colleagues
                to finish my design work, but also I had to present our team’s ideas to the client to move the project
                forward.

            <h2>We needed to get more done within a short time</h2>
            <p>MNG worked as an agency to help SOFY design a mobile VR game. Due to SOFY’s urgent schedule, we needed to
                finish game design in the first week so the VR game developer company, called
                <a href="http://www.anthivegames.com/" target="_blank">Ant Hive</a>, could develop the game demo in
                advance, saving time for testing.
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
            <img class="media-image" src="../images/sv-schedule.png" alt="Schedule gantt chart">
            </div>
                <p>
                Later, we had to hand over remaining deliverables to them, including wireframes and user interfaces.
                Therefore, as an interaction designer, I had to push myself and my teammates to work in a rapidly
                iterated pace for the purpose of meeting the deadline.

            </p>
            <p>
                After the game was finished, SOFY would advertise the game by binding free VR glasses to its products, attracting users to buy their products. </p>
            </p>
            <p class="strong">
                Our goal is to design an interesting and easy-play VR shooting game for teen girls with the
                purpose of increasing the recognition of SOFY.

            <h2>Shooting the foods which are considered bad for girls experiencing
                menstruation</h2>
            <p>Because we wanted to relate the game to SOFY’s sanitary pads, finally we determined to design the game’s
                characters as foods that girls cannot eat when experiencing menstruation. Besides, because our target
                audience was girls 18-24 years old, we chose cute cartoons as the game style.

            <p>Below were challenges we faced:</p>
            <ol class="number-list">
                <li>Aiming to shoot is the only interaction mode we can use, while balancing the appeal and
                    complexity of the game.
                </li>
                <li>Collaborating well with the developer company to implement design, while meeting the urgent
                    deadline.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>To make the game easy to play, users need to do only one thing — moving the crosshair to the
                enemy they want to shoot. And there is no time limit during the game. Users focus only on shooting
                enemies as fast as possible, since we wanted users to be totally absorbed in the game.
            </p>

            </div>
                <p>Also, to make the game interesting to play, we designed three obstacles to make users experience
                new things in different levels.</p>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once a level is done, the game shows users the total points collected based on the number of
                eliminated monsters. When users reach a certain amount of points, the game will unlock the next level
                with new monsters and rules. The calculation will be based on points collected for monsters eliminated and points deducted for
                monsters that touched the player. The monsters will spawn in 3 waves in every level.
            </p>
            <p>
                And there are three levels in total with different difficulty. The game consists of 5 monsters and 2 special
                items, one being the rabbit, which eliminates all monsters on your screen, and the other being the pad, which players need to
                avoid shooting.

            <h5 class="work-section-title">Process</h5>
            <h2>Every design should have a reason behind it</h2>
            <p>After our team finished the game concept design, we delivered our ideas to Ant Hive. Their game designers
                were responsible for all visual design of the VR game, such as moving, hitting, and killing status of
                each monster. Then, I began to work on the pre-game, game-in-progress, and post-game workflow design.</p>
            <p>Below are requirements for my wireframe:</p>
            <ol class="number-list">
                <li>The game feature should be easily noticed and the game can be quickly started.</li>
                <li>Creating a friendly experience for users to transfer from non-VR part to VR part</li>
                <li>Adding a SOFY E-Commerce entry to boost product sales</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                To make the game feature outstanding, I added the new game entry button to the top of the existing app and
                marked a “NEW” text to make it outstanding. After users click the button, they can get into the game.
                And during the loading time, I added a loading image to keep their interest.
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
            <img class="media-image" src="../images/sv-home.png" alt="APP home page">
            </div>
                <p>
                For the home page, I placed the side navigation bar to leave enough space for the main content. The
                navigation bar contains 3 tabs：selecting levels, points redemption, and E-commerce. The default active
                tab is selecting levels. For selecting levels panel, it shows three levels which contain level’s title,
                level’s introduction, and functional buttons, such as tutorial button and start button. If the level is
                locked, I put a lock icon on the top of the panel.
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
            <img class="media-image" src="../images/sv-starting.png" alt="Game home page">
            </div>
                <p>After users click the tutorial button, they go to the tutorial page, which has two parts —about friend
                and about enemy. For each part, users can click the arrow to switch characters. Also, users have the option of jumping tutorial; And I provided start button on the last panel. For the tutorial
                panel, at first I overlooked several problems, which I will explain later.
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
            <img class="media-image" src="../images/sv-tutorial.png" alt="Tutorial page">
            </div>
                <p>For the game flow, after users click the start button, the interface notifies users to put their smartphone
                into VR glasses to play the game.</p>
            <p>Because there is a time-delay when users wear VR glasses, the game won’t start until users aim at the start
                button for 1 second. After one level finishes, users go to the game-over page which presents all
                information from this round. And I also provided a progress bar to tell users how many points they still
                need to get to unlock next level.</p>
            <p>On the redemption page, users can view their current points and redemption history. But due to the
                imitation of business issues, they can only redeem all points at once. I didn’t think it was a good
                marketing idea. I gave feedback to my director that I wanted users can directly user coupons to redeem
                SOFY’s products, which obviously produce more motivation for users to play the game and attract more
                people to use SOFY products. However, my director told me we could do nothing about this part.</p>
            <p class="strong">Then I realized that design is not only about designing a product, but also relates to
                balancing business goals and design goals.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="section container">
        <div class="section-content">
            <h5 class="work-section-title">Modification</h5>
            <h2>Rapid iteration helps the team understand what the client really wants</h2>
            <p>After I collaborated with UI designer in finishing the first high-fidelity version, I needed to prove my
                design towards clients because the PM cannot speak Chinese with Chinese clients. I was confident to
                deliver all my ideas to clients but then I realized that I missed important details after clients pointed
                out their concerns.
            </p>
            <p>Here are concerns clients had:</p>
            <ol class="number-list">
                <li>The start game button was not conspicuous to see and button size should be bigger considering the VR
                    scenario.
                </li>
                <li>The interaction mode of selecting levels was inconsistent. At the beginning users select levels with their
                    fingers, but in the end users select levels with their eyes.
                </li>
                <li>The tutorial pages were tedious and we should let users browse them as quickly as possible.</li>
                <li>The ending page lacked a sense of reward, which could motivate users to play longer.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                After much consideration, I overthrew my previous design and came up with better ideas to solve these
                concerns. First, I changed the home page layout to highlight the START button and enlarged buttons' size to make
                them easier to be controlled. Then I changed the way to select levels from manual control to eye control, making it easier for users
                to switch levels without taking off VR glasses.
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
            <img class="media-image" src="../images/sv-startflow.png" alt="Starting flow">
            </div>
            <p>
                Also, I changed the browsing gesture of tutorial page from left & right clicking to up & down scrolling,
                which greatly expedited users' browsing speed.
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">

            </div>
                <p>
                Last but not least, I added extra details for the ending page with a pad and a rabbit fading in
                together, to give users a sense of reward. Then characters fade out and level selection fades in.
            </p>

            <img class="media-image" src="../images/sv-ending.png" alt="Ending page">
            </div>
                <p class="strong">After we put up the new design detailing all these changes, clients happily accepted our
                final design.</p>

            <h2>Put yourself into users' shoes when you design</h2>
            <p>
                I realized that I made many design flaws because I designed the product mostly from my personal
                experience. I missed many edge cases from a real user’s point of view at the very beginning. I should
                have thought the whole game flow from an amateur gamer’s point of view. It’s necessary for designers to
                have the ability to switch to users’ thinking model.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, was the button a call to action? CTA buttons must be adequately sized and a minimum of 44
                points is usually sufficient. Was the button big enough to be controlled by the eyes? Clicking the button by using eyes is more difficult than by fingers. Considering the usage scenarios is very
                important. What is the primary goal of users? After you decide the primary goal, try your best to make
                it stand out.
            </p>
            <p class="strong">
                Also, clients are your users too. Design a smart way to collaborate with them and make them happy with
                your design.

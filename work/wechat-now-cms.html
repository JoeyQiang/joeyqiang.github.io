                WeChat Now CMS was a customized WeChat Account Back-end management system developed to support
                customized design. Clients could create different features using the system, which provided the most
                convenient way to help both themselves and users to achieve goals. As an intern, I was responsible to
                propose a version 2.0 design to improve its functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this design experience, I studied a lot about the difference between to-customer product design
                and to-busineess product design. Meanwhile, this experience taught me that functionality and logic
                should be weighted much higher than fancy interfaces for Back-end product.

            <h2>WeChat is more than just a social network</h2>
            <p>In China, WeChat has now become businesses’ preferred service innovation channel because users could
                access to businesses' service offerings by following their official WeChat account. Moreover, using
                WeChat APIs, businesses can customize store, deliver business ideas, and manage customer relationship
                and so on. Therefore, MNG wanted to catch the opportunity to provide one-stop service for business
                clients.
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">

            </div>
            <p>
                This project was a long-term one and it started since 2015, which was one of the core business of Mobile
                Now Group. Because the designer who responsible to this project was going to leave the company, I was
                the person she needed to hand over. Therefore, I had to understand all background information of this
                project very quickly. Also, based on the current design, I needed to explore outside to infuse
                innovative ideas into it so clients would like to purchase the new version

            </p>
            <p class="strong">
                Because one of my design principle is less is more, I set the goal of my new design is easy-understood,
                easy-browsing, and easy-using.

            <h5 class="work-section-title">Process</h5>
            <h2>Catch users' pain points and detect acceptable resolutions</h2>
            <p>Since it’s an Back-end product whose clients were companies, not like to-customers product, I needed to
                specify what were features that clients really want. Also, I needed to do research on WeChat APIs to
                figure out what technical solutions they provide, and what technical restrictions they set.
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/wn-ta.png" alt="Technology architecture">
            </div>
            <p>Through discussing with my boss and director, I defined the 3 main reasons why businesses had to buy our
                product:</p>
            <ol class="number-list">
                <li>Boosting their products sales.
                </li>
                <li>Helping them better understand their users.
                </li>
                <li>Enhancing the popularity of their marketing campaign.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Next step was to defined how could we help them achieve these goals through WeChat account CMS. WeChat
                business account had a main function of sending certain type of message to your users 4 times in a
                month, such as article, sound, and video. After a well-thought meeting, our team determined to take this
                function as the starting point and breakthrough.
            </p>
            <p>How could we maximize use the limited 4 times sending opportunity? The idea was that we tried to define
                the category of each user and segmented them into specified groups. Later, it allowed clients to sent
                specified message to each group, which greatly increased the utility of each message.
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/wn-sending.png" alt="Articles sending optimization">
            </div>
            <p>
                Later, to help clients send multiple messages more efficient, we proposed scheduling message sending
                function, which allowed users to determine sending time in advance and then message would be sent then
                automatically. Besides, how could we boost their products sales? We believed that there should be a
                connection between business’ online service and offline service. That’s how we proposed the idea of
                Points of Interests (POI). Based on users’ locations or clients’ requirements, users can access to their
                offline interested points by using WeChat online navigation.
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/wn-poi-scenario.png" alt="Two POI scenarios">
            </div>
            <p>What’s more, how could we enhance marking campaign popularity? In another words, how could we make users
                more easier to get access to marketing information? We decided to use QR code as the media because in
                China, scanning QR code had been everyone-known behavior. Therefore, we designed the function called QR
                campaign — connecting campaign with QR code. Last, to help clients better understand their users, we
                redesigned the analytics module to provide detailed data for clients to analyze.</p>

            <h5 class="work-section-title">Solution</h5>
            <h2>Rapid iteration helps the team understand what the client really wants</h2>
            <p>I used Axure to build prototype and interaction effects. Here was the information architecture of the
                CMS:</p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/wn-ia.png" alt="Information architecture">
            </div>
            <p>
                The index page of the online platform was the dashboard page. What we wanted to do here was to make
                clients get a quick feedback of their accounts’ live feed. The dashboard was the central admin panel
                where administrator can access the different data collected by CMS, such as the total number of
                followers, the broadcast views of groups, the ranks of QR campaign. By the way, clients can customize
                the dashboard page based on their hobbies.
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/wn-dashboard.png" alt="Dashboard">
            </div>
            <p>
                As I described above, tags were the bridge connecting articles and users. Clients could track the
                interest of followers by adding tags to published contents. Therefore, followers' behaviour can be
                defined by their actions with contents, such as view, like and share.
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/wn-tag.png" alt="Tag management">
            </div>
            <p>
                Besides using tags to define followers, group segmentation also supported many other attributes to
                create group, such as gender, age, region, language, following time, active time, and QR campaign
                labels. We didn’t add QR campaign labels as an attribute at the first time, however, when we reviewed
                the draft wireframe, we thought it’s a good idea to build more relationships among platform’s modules,
                proving clients more options.
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/wn-group.png" alt="Group segmentation">
            </div>
            <p>
                Targeted broadcast scheduling allowed clients send customized news to certain groups. Also, it supported
                schedule broadcasts ahead of time, which was a very demanding function for many businesses based on our
                survey. Supposed your business would like to send morning news to users per day at 6 a.m., which was
                difficult to manually achieve without errors everyday. Now, this function relieved all your pains.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>By using POI finders, clients could set interesting places around followers in two interaction modes. One
                was that followers could get a POI list by sending their location to CMS Back-end. Moreover, given the
                fact that WeChat account supported embedded HTML5 website, we designed a more friendly usage situation —
                followers could jump to a customized POI H5 website by tabbing a menu item.</p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/wn-poi.png" alt="POI finder">
            </div>
            <p>By creating a QR campaign, a QR code would be generated automatically attaching with the campaign. Then
                clients could track users who scanned the QR code to analyze their behaviors. Besides, the Analytics
                module could calculate the total scanning number of each campaign so clients could know each campaign’s
                performance.</p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/wn-campaign.png" alt="QR campaign">

            <p class="strong">Through one and half month of research and experimentation, the boss finally
                enthusiastically passed our design proposition.</p>

            <h2>Explore more usage scenarios and make your design fits all of them.</h2>
            <p>
                My director was an experienced designer and I learnt some of his thinking modes when I worked with
                him. Firstly, he tried to make the design satisfy business goals. We have to design something which
                can be sold, which is how we make a living. Therefore, you need to specify usage scenarios of
                how each person uses your product.
            </p>
            <p>
                More importantly, after you come up with one scenario and design your solution for it, don’t stop. Keep
                looking for potential scenarios. Brainstorm all kinds of possible conditions without thinking technical
                restrictions first — the diverging phase. Later, you can narrow your ideas after balancing restrictions
                —the converging phase. Last, make sure your design fits all scenarios to make everyone happy.

            <p>
                ACUVUE was a WeChat-based Web APP that helps users get online support efficiently, such as Q&A, online
                shopping, and online redemption; These assist users to care for their eyes anytime anywhere, while
                enhancing Acuvue’s brand awareness and promoting its product sales.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because ACUVUE wasn’t satisfied with their current APP, it asked MNG to make suggestion for improvement.
                And as an intern UX designer at MNG, I was assigned the task of analyzing the current version and
                proposing a redesign solution so that the project manager could sell the solution to ACUVUE. It's my
                first project at MNG and I took it seriously because I felt excited to show my design abilities.

    <div class="section container context">
        <div class="section-content">
            <h5 class="work-section-title">Problem</h5>
            <h2>Defining existing problems took me forever</h2>
            <p>Since there were so many problems for the APP, after I went through all the pages, I
                summarized its information architecture to help me better examine its logic.
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/ac-ia.png" alt="Previous IA">
            </div>
            <p>
                Then, for each part of the APP, I tried to define its problems based on my knowledge about user
                experience
                design. If I had some questions, I would reach out for help from my director, but I finished almost all
                of them by myself. Here we go:
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/ac-instruction.png" alt="Instruction page">
            </div>
            <p>
                For the Instruction page, I thought instructions should be question-centered instead of answer-centered.
                And after I clicked one answer, the detail page would open up in a new web page, which forced me have to
                go back every time, but I preferred a smooth one-page reading experience. </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/ac-product.png" alt="Product page">
            </div>
            <p>For the Product page, the big images caused slow loading speed. Also, the huge annotation of “Clicking
                image to see details" wasn’t necessary since the card section should self-explain that it's clickable.
                Also, the top menu bar wasn't sufficiently conspicuous.</p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/ac-store.png" alt="Store finder page">
            </div>
            <p>For the Store finder page, the advertisement image not only didn’t increase user experience, but also
                hampered it, because it took up the hero area which made the core function (store location), hard to be
                found by users. Besides, when users searched a shop location, the useful map view feature was hidden in
                default. Instead, a text-based address showed up, which totally disrupted the order.
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/ac-free.png" alt="Free sample page">
            </div>
            <p>For the Free sample page, there were too many form fields to fill, which was crazy. And there was a minor
                technical bug that when you went into the page, the scroll bar always jumped down some distance, which
                distracted users’ browsing experience.
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/ac-coupon.png" alt="Coupon page">
            </div>
            <p>For the Coupon page, the heavy image introduction should be replaced with html and css, which could save
                network resource. Also, similar to the free-sample page, users directly jumped down to the form area,
                completely skipping the coupon instruction area, which meant many users had to scroll back if they
                wanted to see the instructions.</p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/ac-points.png" alt="Points store page">
            </div>
            <p>For the Points store page, there was no clue telling users how many points they already had. Also, if an
                unlogged user clicked a product to check details, there would be an alert popping up telling the user to
                log in first. It would be better to directly jump to the log-in page when the website detected the
                unlogged status.</p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/ac-gift.png" alt="Gift redemption page">
            </div>
            <p>For the Gift redemption page, the redemption history button was only a text one, which didn’t look
                clickable. Also, the redemption process was redundant that asked users to do many unnecessary steps. Why
                wouldn’t it be more convenient for users? For example, a one-click redemption.</p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/ac-redemption.png" alt="Redemption rule page">
            </div>
            <p>For the Redemption rule page, the title of “member card number” was meaningless for unauthenticated users
                but the title was always there. Also, the redemption rules should be simplified. Now it’s hard to for an
                ordinary person to figure them out.</p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/ac-registration.png"
                     alt="Admin registration and User registration page">
            </div>
            <p>For the Admin registration page, the page should not be visible to users because it’s not a
                function for customers. And for the User registration page, first, the registration form was also
                redundant. Second, the page title should be replaced with my account because the title of “user
                registration” wouldn’t make sense any more after users finished registration.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>User journey map helped me think of better solutions</h2>
            <p>Based on client information, I summarized three personas to help me understand different people’s
                requirements, each of them representing a certain type of people. Later, I put myself into each
                person’s position, imagining what would be a good user experience for myself. Here were the user
                journeys of three people:</p>

                        <li>A clerk directs Amber to an optometrist to choose the contacts that fit her requirements and
                            recommends the WeChat official account to Amber.
                        </li>
                        <li>Amber follows the official account then registers to get points and coupons. Now, she can
                            use the points to redeem gifts, and she can also browse products and discover surrounding
                            stores online.

                    <span>John is an experienced user. He has been using ACUVUE contacts for a while but he never uses the ACUVUE WeChat account. He also needs to purchase contacts regularly.</span>

                            He follows it and registers.
                        </li>
                        <li>John buys the contacts with a coupon at the store. The clerk tells him that he accumulates
                            the points that can be redeemed online.
                        </li>
                        <li>John begins to accumulates points on purpose. Because he learns that he can order free
                            samples online, he starts to pay attention to promotion activities.

                        <li>Linda buys the contacts then asks a clerk how many points she can get. She asks a clerk if

            </div>
            <p>For Product page, first, I kept all three products within one page, saving users’ browsing time. Next, I
                changed the link of free samples to a more attractive CTA button which was put at the
                bottom of the page, motivating users to click it. Also, I classified coupons to limited and unlimited
                ones, motivating users to use coupons as soon as possible. In another words, motivating users to buy
                products as soon as possible.</p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">

            </div>
            <p>
                For Guidance page, first, I changed the layout to question-centered style. Then I added a product
                recommendation banner to its related question, increasing the product’s selling conversion rate. Also, I
                changed the interaction method of viewing full answer, from jumping to another page to expanding under the
                question.</p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/ac-new-store.png" alt="New store finder page">
            </div>
            <p>For Store finder page, I directly used map view to give users a clear and straightforward searching
                experience. Specifically, I showed several surrounding stores in default based on users' locations.
                Besides, I put the nearest store's detailed information on the bottom of the page. Search function also
                is supported to satisfy users who want to search certain stores. After users select the store, they
                can navigate to the location by using WeChat Map API.

            <p>For Coupon page, in default, users have two different types of coupons after they log in,
                motivating them to purchase products. Also, the Back-end should send coupons to users from time to time,
                prompting users when they land on the page. Another detail was that I provided a coupon link at the
                bottom of the page. Clients can use it to collect personal information from users if they wish.</p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">

            </div>
            <p>For Points & Redemption page, I redesigned the layout, giving a bottom link which can jump to
                redemption-rule page, which builds the connection between two pages. Also, I added a progress bar to each
                product, informing users of remaining actions to exchange the product, which encouragea users to collect
                more points. After redeeming a product, users can view redemption history on My account page.</p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/ac-myaccount.png" alt="My account page">
            </div>
            <p>For My account page, besides changing the page title, I added coupons and redemption history to the
                page so users can see more information on the account page. Another minor detail is that the first
                time when users land on the page, I ask them to sign up so they can directly use 100 points to
                redeem products, encouraging users to sign up.</p>

            <h2>Focusing on details paid off in the end</h2>
            <p>
                This was a project relating much about improving user experience. It’s not a project which required you
                to draw a big vision and defined functions. However, I really enjoyed the experience, because I tried my best to focus on each minor detail and explored ways to improve them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though improving one or two details may not change much about a product, quantity will finally turn into
                quality. If you can make sure every detail is in its best form, you can turn a good product into a
                perfect one. I believe that focusing on details, all your hard work will pay off in the end.

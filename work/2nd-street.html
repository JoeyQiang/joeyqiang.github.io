                2ND Street is a local craigslist-like classified advertisement site that helps Chinese students at KU
                share useful information with each other, such as selling used products, renting a house, and posting
                interesting activities, ultimately facilitating foreign students’adaptation to new environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                I launched the project as the product designer with two teammates in October 2015. I was mainly
                responsible for designing the website, managing the team and building relationships with Chinese
                students. One teammate was responsible for developing website and the other one was for marketing. All
                in all, it’s an unforgettable experience that the first time I leaded a project in the USA and it did
                taught me many practical lessons.

            <h2>I knew exactly what you needed</h2>
            <p>I experienced a lot of hardships in my first year in the United States. As an international student, I deeply undertood how many difficulties a beginner needed to overcome when he or she stepped into a new environment.
                Therefore, I often doubted myself — could I do something to improve the situation?
            </p>

            <p class="strong">Willingness to help people was always the power encouraging me to keep the project going
                forward. If I could better someone’s life even a little bit, that would be my greatest comfort.

            <h5 class="work-section-title">Process</h5>
            <h2>User-centered design was always my design principle</h2>
            <p>Because I was a Chinese student, as both the user and the designer, I knew who users were and what users
                wanted. Our main users were Chinese students at the University of Kansas, who wanted to reduce their
                economic burden by purchasing used products. However, due to lacking a local platform, they could only
                choose big platform like craigslist, which was not very effective to finish transaction.
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, my goal was to build a Chinese-based localized fast transaction platform. To achieve the goal,
                my considerations had 3 main aspects:</p>
            <ul class="column-list row">
                <li class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4">
                    <img src="../images/2n-economy.png" alt="Economy">
                    <h5>Economy</h5>
                    <span>Make users feel that the products' price was attractive</span>
                </li>
                <li class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4">
                    <img src="../images/2n-safety.png" alt="Safety">
                    <h5>Safety</h5>
                    <span>Filter our users to be KU students only for the sake of transaction security</span>
                </li>
                <li class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4">
                    <img src="../images/2n-convenience.png" alt="Convenience">
                    <h5>Convenience</h5>
                    <span>Streamline the posting and finding experience as convenient as possible</span>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>For the economy aspect, my idea was to ask users to input original price and selling price on the posting
                step, so later other people could feel they enjoyed a good bargain when they saw the price gap. And I
                really concerned about the safety aspect because I didn’t want anyone was cheat when they using my
                product. Therefore, I decided to ask users to input their KU ID as an authentication when they signed up
                their account.
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, for the sake of convenience—making users spend the least time to finish
                posting, I put the posting button at the bottom center of the index page and greatly streamlined the
                posting form. Of course, to make our target users become more familiar with the website, I decided to
                use Chinese as the website language.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                As to the marketing aspect, I created a WeChat official account and asked my teammate to publish interesting articles everyday. Though reposting articles among our friends, we gradually accumulated our first users. And we used QQ group and WeChat account to main relationships with them and received suggestion from them about improving our website. To make users better access to us, we created a closed loop with website, QQ and WeChat.

            <h2>Worked hard together as a team could make everyone more powerful</h2>
            <p>I designed the interfaces by using the new popular design tool — Sketch, which was really handy. I thought it’s much more easier to design interfaces than Photoshop. </p>
            <p class="strong">Finding the right tools to design could save you a lot of time.</p>
            <p>
                To make sure all our ideas could be achieved, we used <a href="https://worktile.com/" target="_blank">Worktile</a> as the task management platform. I posted new features, bugs, and marketing plan on it. My teammates checked tasks regularly. And after I received the notification that they finished one task, I checked whether it’s completed as I expected. Moreover, sometimes when I saw an attractive project, I would use the CMS to move the product to the top.

            <p>
                The project lasted around 8 months, and I did meet many challenges. For example, because my team lacked experienced people for operation, creating challenges when we wanted to expand market. Also, I made a huge decision mistake which made the beginning phase into trouble. When I design the website, I designed the desktop version first, then the mobile version. After we launched the desktop version, few people used them. However, since the mobile version was launched on December, the daily page views of the website keep increasing. Because mobile users have become the mainstream users, creating a mobile version first would be rational in most cases.

                6 months later, we covered 20% Chinese students at KU and received many thanks from the Back-end message inbox.

            <h2>
                Doing things with right people is much more important than doing right things.
            </h2>
            <p>
                Because my teammates and I were all enthusiastic about Internet products and would like to catch this opportunity to horn our ability, our team had an active and collaborative working atmosphere, which saved me much energy. But I still needed spend much time to maintain a good co-working relationship to keep all of us on the same page. Sometimes, when I had to make a decision when the team had disagreement, that’s really tough.
            </p>
            <p>
                I remembered that once I wanted to give up after receiving many ridicules, it’s their encouragement that made me overcome the difficulty. I could just let the project go but I didn’t want to let my teammates down. When you work with the right people, they can light your life and move forward together with you. Even though the project was finally ending with lacking budget, I really thanked them to leave me such a beautiful memory.

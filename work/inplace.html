                INPLACE is a service exchange mobile APP that connects providers with those in need of services. This
                solution is designed to bring a shared sense of community to our seniors who want to share accumulated
                resources such as time, presence, and knowledge, with recipients looking for personal enrichment.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was the final project of the class—Service Design, which I finished in January 2016. I collaborated
                with an American boy to finish all design, including research, problem identification, persona,
                storyboard, wireframe, Hi-Fi prototype and usability test. After I finished this project in a tight
                schedule, I realized that I really enjoy the design process and I’d love to take UX as my life career.

            <h5 class="work-section-title">Context</h5>
            <h2>It's time for us to think of ourselves in 50 years</h2>
            <p>We could discovered from the below changing inverted pyramid that United States was getting old. The
                decreasing number of children born in country was changing how society operated and was impacting slowly
                aging the country.In today’s world, elderly people sometimes were considered problems or burdens for
                their families and our society in general. Because of this, we needed to think how today’s younger
                generation would do to improve the situation, not only for the current seniors, but also for the future
                ourselves.

    <div class="section container">
        <div class="section-content">
            <h5 class="work-section-title">Process</h5>
            <h2>User-centered design was always my design principle</h2>
            <p>After discussion in class, we knew that basic personal, household and transportation services were in
                high demand and in short supply for seniors. We decided to do research on ways to afford greater
                autonomy to older adults, thus enabling them to live conveniently and longer in their own homes. After
                interviewed 6 seniors about what they needed. We summarized the figure below.</p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/ip-activities.png"
                     alt="Needed activities of daily living for older adults">
            </div>
            <p>Then we built two personas from real examples to help us better understand our users:
            </p>
            <ul class="column-list row">
                <li class="col-xs-12 col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-1">
                    <img src="../images/ip-persona1.png" alt="Kelly">
                    <h5>Kelly 18 years old</h5>
                    <span>I am a senior student in high school who comes from a large family. While growing up, my parents shared with me the importance of volunteering and giving back. Therefore, when I move off to college, I want to continue helping by maybe working in a hospital or half-way house. It will be nice to connect with others while saving a little money for school.</span>
                </li>
                <li class="col-xs-12 col-sm-5">
                    <img src="../images/ip-persona2.png" alt="Mary">
                    <h5>Mary 68 years old</h5>
                    <span>I am a retired nurse. I raised a family and have lived in this community for over 30 years. 4 months ago I experienced a mild stroke and it has become more difficult for me to take care of myself. The thought of moving to an assisted living home depresses me. I would like to stay in my home as long as I can and be around the things I love.</span>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Then we began designing the user journey map, which built the general structure of our service design.
                [Aware-Join-Use-Develop-Leave, 5 images]
            </p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/ip-journey.png" alt="User journey map">
            </div>
            <p>Based on the journey map, we drew a simplified skeleton of how our service APP worked and then we would
                turn it into the
                interfaces.</p>
            <div class="media-image-wrap">
                <img class="media-image" src="../images/ip-flow.png" alt="APP workflow">

        </div>
    </div>


    <div class="section container">
        <div class="section-content">
            <h5 class="work-section-title">Solution</h5>
            <h2>When I thought it's fine, I pushed myself 5% more</h2>
            <p>To make users have a fantastic experience through the workflow, Harvey and I summarized 3 rules which we
                needed to follow when drawing the interfaces.</p>
            <ol class="number-list">
                <li><strong>Concision:</strong> It should be easy to use, and give users a sense of autonomy.</li>
                <li><strong>Diversity:</strong> It allowed users to search for various types of value or resources
                    within the local community.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Growth:</strong> It gave users the ability to rate their experience to better match them
                    with future providers and
                    support reciprocal exchanges.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Here were part of the details of the UI. After users lauchned InPlace, they would see walkthrough
                pages to get a general idea about the APP. What I could do with the it.
                Then they would be asked to answer several quesitons so that InPlace could later send customized content
                them. There were four main parts of the APP.</p>
            <p>
                First was the home page on which users
                could view posting information. On its top left, there was a identification switch button. Users could
                transfer their identification between the seniors and the youngsters by clicking the button.
                Accordingly, the home page content would change. On the top right, it's the posting button.
                After clicking it, users followed a straightforward four steps guidance to post message.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part was the message part. Users could chat with other people on this page. Besides, they
                would receive system notifications on this page. The third part was the activity which seemed like a reminder calendor.
                After users accepted a task from another one, InPlace would automatically save the task's schedule on this page. The last part was the
                me part which contained users' personal information and history.

            <h5 class="work-section-title">Reflection</h5>
            <h2>Stand on the shoulder of giants</h2>
            <p>
                When Harvey and I started doing research about the project, we searched tons of reference materials to
                explore our minds, such as the aging problem, the elderly community description, the related service
                introduction. And during the searching process, we often luckily found something inspiring, which
                provided a solid support for our material library.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortunately, I was born in the 21st century, the Internet era. I could found awesome ideas from genius
                within a second. By analyzing their works, I could acquire useful experience that maybe I needed 10
                years or even longer to realize myself. Many thanks for those people who like to share knowledge to
                others. If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.
